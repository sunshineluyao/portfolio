Figure 1 represents the Decentralization Index of the AAVE token from October 2020 to October 2022 represented in a heat map. The x-axis shows the date, and the y-axis shows the index value. The legend shows that as the number of counts at a certain value increases, the color shown in the heat map is brighter and yellow. As the number of counts at a certain value decreases, the color becomes darker and purple. From this figure, we can see that until about October 2021, the decentralization of AAVE was relatively scattered and more decentralized. However, after October 2021, the values concentrate around 0-100 with minimal variance.
